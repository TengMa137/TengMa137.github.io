This blog post go through the basics of point cloud data and related projects I have done, including point cloud registration, point cloud segmentation. 

Basics of PCD
======
Point cloud data contains information of a set of points in three-dimensional space. Each point is represented as a vector of its 3D Cartesian coordinates
(x, y, z), plus other information such as color (RGB), reflection intensity (Intensity) etc. Point cloud data can be acquired from LiDAR, RADAR, RGB-D cameras, or derived from images using multi-view stereo vision algorithms. 

Point Cloud Registration
======
One of the base tasks in the applications of PCD is point cloud registration. The idea behind is to get the transformation information by matching adjacent point clouds, thus to ground the high level tasks such as state estimation of a moving robot. Matching two point clouds actually means finding the same set of points that shows in both point clouds and calculate the transformation matrix. However, it's nontrivial to find the points consistent in two point clouds. There are many sophisticated hand crafted descriptors to help find similar points in two point clouds, deep learning based methods are also on the table. ![A pipeline of point cloud registration](profile.png)
