This blog post go through the basics of point cloud data and related projects I have done, including point cloud registration, point cloud segmentation. 

Basics of PCD
======
Point cloud data contains information of a set of points in three-dimensional space. Each point is represented as a vector of its 3D Cartesian coordinates
(x, y, z), plus other information such as color (RGB), reflection intensity (Intensity) etc. Point cloud data can be acquired from LiDAR, RADAR, RGB-D cameras, or derived from images using multi-view stereo vision algorithms. 

Point Cloud Registration
======
One of the base tasks in the applications of PCD is point cloud registration. The idea behind is to get the transformation information by matching adjacent point clouds, thus to obtain the state of a moving robot.
