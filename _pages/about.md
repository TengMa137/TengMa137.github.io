I am a highly self-motivated junior Software Developer with a diverse skill set encompassing Software Development, Machine Learning, and Computer vision. My passion for these fields has been evident throughout my professional journey.  During my internship at Volvo CE, I had the opportunity to delve into 3D Computer Vision in the context of Autonomous Driving, conducting valuable research on this cutting-edge topic.

Alongside course projects, I actively pursue various areas of interest and work on personal projects. This continuous exploration not only keeps me updated with the latest advancements but also hones my practical skills. I hold a bachelor's degree in Automation and have furthered my education by completing a master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from KTH, Stockholm.

One of my key strengths lies in my ability to swiftly grasp new concepts. I am a fast learner, always eager to acquire new techniques and expand my knowledge base, even during my spare time. This enthusiasm enables me to adapt seamlessly to different roles and projects, ensuring that I deliver exceptional results.

Ultimately, my overarching goal in life is to strive for my own global maximum, constantly pushing my boundaries and achieving new heights.
